# soundcore-rs

A Rust library that handles Soundcore device communication.

#### NOTE: This library does not provide any bluetooth/RFcomm implementation!


## Roadmap
- Implement a BaseSoundcoreDevice trait
- Seperate each device group to its own implementation
- Document more of the protocol to simplify the "building" of a command
- Clean up code/Remove unneeded unwraps
