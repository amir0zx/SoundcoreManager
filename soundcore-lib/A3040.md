# Q45/A3040
#### Note: Q45 uses a dynamic dispatch system to send and receive data 


## Important Classes 
- Cmm2BtDeviceManager (Used by other devices)
    - void ReceiveData (Dispatches the received data to the appropriate handler)
- IAnalyzeRDService (Base Interface)
- A3040MainActivity
- A3040CmdService -> A3952CmdService -> CmmBtCmdService (extension chain)
    - Note: A3040 Overrides SendANC
- Cmm2CmdData (Commands)
- CmmBtCmdService
    - BuildEqDataBean (used for many devices, similar to A3951 build anc method which is kinda generic)
- A3040EqVm

# Data Flow
- A3040DeviceModel
    - Creates A3040CmdService (Used for Writes)
    - Creates A3040AnalysisService (Used for Reads)
    - Passes the above to Cmm2BtDevicemanager 
- BaseBtDispatch -> handleMessage -> BaseBtDispatch.HandleDispatchedMessage


# Responses
- Battery Level -> bArr[9]
- Battery Charging -> Left: bArr[9], Right: bArr[10] (General, but applicable)

# TODO
Create a simple CLI tool which sends commands and prints out the response for the users to report in GH (using dialoger)
